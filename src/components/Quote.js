      <p className='quote-text'>I believe that when we cultivate presence through a daily mindfulness practice and learn to bring a sense of curiosity, kindness, and compassion to ourselves and our experiences, we become more courageous and better able to embrace ourselves as we are in all of our humanity, slowly overcoming our shared fear of vulnerability. It is the key to real change and freedom, freedom to be with the judgment, the fear, and the shame that may arise without making it mean anything about our innate worth, and freedom to be who we authentically are. </p>
